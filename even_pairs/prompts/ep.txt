Please determine the total numbers of 'ab' and 'ba' is even or not in the list following the steps below, directly give the answer without showing any reasoning steps:
    1. Initialize the 'count' to 0.
    2. For each letter in the list, if the letter is different from the next letter, increment the 'count' by 1. Output the count.
    3. Terminate when the letter is the last element in the list, and output the 'True' if the count is even, otherwise output the 'False'.
The output should be formatted as a dictionary with the key 'Result'. Do not output the individual counts. For example, if the input list is '['a', 'b', 'b', 'a']', the final output should be concluded with {'Result': True}.
