Given a sequence of movements on a cycle of length 5, compute the end position. The movements are STAY, INCREASE, DECREASE and are represented as {0, 1, 2}.
Please determine the agent's final position after executing all movements in the list following the steps, directly give the answer without showing any reasoning steps:
    1. Initialize 'state' to 0.
    2. For every movement in the list: increment 'state' by 1 if the movement is 1, decrement 'state' by 1 if the movement is 2.
    3. After every movement in the list id taken, the final position is 'state' modulo 5.
The output should be formatted as a dictionary with the key 'Result'. Do not output the individual counts. For example, if the input list is '['0', '1', '2', '1']', the final output should be concluded with {'Result': 1}.
